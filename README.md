# 2023CUMCM Problem B

This is a repo including all matlab codes, images and our paper for the Problem B in 2023 CUMCM. Although this is our first time to compete in such a modeling contest, we're lucky to win a **second prize** in Shanghai competition area.

The _pdf_ file for the problem B can be found [here](https://github.com/Dasher-mango/2023CUMCM/blob/main/B%E9%A2%98.pdf).


The problem is broken into four subproblems, which are listed below
- Establish a mathematical model for the coverage width of multi-beam bathymetry and the overlap rate between adjacent strips.
- Establish a mathematical model of the multi-beam bathymetry coverage width for a given direction $\beta$ and a given rectangle area.
- Design a group of measurement line with the shortest length under the given condition of overlap rate.
- Design measurement line for a given sea ​​water depth data in _Excel_.

The matlab codes in the file matlab_code correspond to the above subproblems respectively.
> The code "P_4.m" is incomplete.
